# Lesson 5: Managed Servies for Machine Learning

The machine learning process can be labor intensive. Machine learning requires a number of tools to prepare the data, train the models, and deploy the models. Most of the work usually takes place within web-based, interactive notebooks, such as Jupyter notebooks. Although notebooks are lightweight and easily run in a web browser, you still need a server to to host them. Typically, this involves installing several applications and libraries on a machine, configuring the environment settings, and then loading any additional resources required to begin working within notebooks or integrated development environments (IDEs).

All this setup takes time, and there is sometimes a fair amount of troubleshooting involved to make sure you have the right combination of software versions that are compatible with one another. This is the advantage of managed services for machine learning, which provide a ready-made environment that is pre-optimized for your machine learning development.
