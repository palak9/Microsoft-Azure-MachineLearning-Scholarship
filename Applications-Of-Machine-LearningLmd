# Microsoft Azure Machine Learning by Udacity - Lesson 5: Applications of ML

ðŸ‘‰Classical ML vs Deep Learning

- Artificial Intelligence includes Machine Learning, which includes Deep Learning. 
- All DL algorithms are particular cases of ML algorithms, but it's not true that all ML algorithms are DL. 

ðŸ‘‰What is Deep Learning

Machine Learning is a subset of AI and Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning which refers to a special class of algorithms based on neural networks. 

ðŸ‘‰Characteristics of DL

- Highly effective in learning multi-dimensional, nonlinear functions. 
- Massive amounts of training data
- Excels with raw, unstructured data.
-  Automatic Feature extraction 
- Computationally expensive (GPUs/TPUs)

ðŸ‘‰Benefits of DL

- The non-parametric approach taken by neural nets allows them to learn arbitrarily complex functions.
- They can learn complex patterns without explicitly seeing them. 
- Effective across various incarnations of data (numbers, images, text)
- Work on large sets of data.
- Can be distributed for parallel training. 
- Can learn time-related patterns (RNN).
- Capable of reaching on - par performance with certain human activities. 

ðŸ‘‰Applications of DL
1. Language Translation 
2. Image recognition
3. Speech Recognition
4. Forecasting
5. Predictive Analytics
6. Autonomous vehicles and much more

Eg: Deep learning in text analytics 
- search, semantics, sentiments, summarization, classification, clustering. 

ðŸ‘‰ Approaches to Machine Learning 
These are three main approaches 
Supervised Learning : 
â€‹Classification 
â€‹Regression
â€‹Similarity Learning - learns from examples using a similarity function, used in recommendation systems.
â€‹Feature Learning
â€‹Anomaly Detection - learns from data labeled as normal/abnormal 

â€‹Unsupervised Learning : 
â€‹Clustering 
â€‹Feature Learning - features are learned from unlabeled data.
â€‹Anomaly Detection - learns from unlabeled data assuming most entities are normal.

â€‹Reinforcement Learning - learns how an agent should take action in an environment to maximize a reward function.
â€‹Markov Decision Process - does not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model.
