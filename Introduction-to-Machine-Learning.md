ðŸ‘‰Data Science Process -
1. Collect Data
2. Prepare Data
3. Train model
4. Evaluate model
5. Deploy model (retrain model)

ðŸ‘‰Common types of data
$ It's all numerical in the end 
1. Numerical
2. Time-series eg: stocks
3. Categorical(discrete)
4. Text eg: news article 
5. Image

ðŸ‘‰Tabular Data:
  Data that is arranged in a data table. Similar to the spreadsheet.
  
    1. Row - an item/entity
    2. Column - a property 
    3. Single value - cell

In ML we ultimately work with vectors 
Vector - an array of numbers or a nested array that contains other arrays of numbers.

ðŸ‘‰Scaling Data : 
Scaling data means transforming it So that the values fit within some range or scale, such as 0-100 or 0-1. 
Why scale the data? - to speed up the training process. 
Two approaches : 
1. Standardization - rescales the data to have mean = 0 and variance = 1. 

Variance - average of sqaured differences from the mean.

Standard deviation - sqaured root of variance = (x-mean)/standard-deviation 

2. Normalization - rescales the data into the range [0,1] = (x-xmin)/(y-ymin)

---

ðŸ‘‰Encoding Categorical Data: 
Two approaches 

1. Ordinal encoding - convert the categorical data into integers ranging from 0 to (no of categories -1)
Drawback : implicitly assumes order across the categories which is meaningless. 

2. One hot encoding - convert each categorical value into a column.

ðŸ‘‰Image Data: 
**How to convert image into vectors?** 

**Each pixel can be represented by a vector of three numbers (RGB)**

- Encoding an Image: 
1. Horizontal position of each pixel.
2. Vertical position of each pixel.
3. Color of each pixel. 

Size of the vector = height*width*depth of that image. 
Each cell in the matrix represents the pixel value.

ðŸ‘‰Text Data:
- Normalization -
1. Lemmatization 
2. Tokenization 

- Vectorization - 
1. TFIDF
2. Word2Vec or GloVe

ðŸ‘‰Two Perspectives on ML

1. Computer Science-
Input features -> Program -> Output = program(input features)

2. Statistical 
Mathematical function ->  Independent variables -> Dependent variables = f(independent var)
